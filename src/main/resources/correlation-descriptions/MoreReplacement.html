<b>Correlation Replacements</b>
<p>You can select one Correlation Replacement from this ComboBox, adding configurations that will
    allow you replace values on each request.</p>
<p>Notice that you don't need to pick a C. Replacement if you don't need it since a rule is <b>
    complete</b>, as long as it has either a Correlation Replacement <br> or a Correlation Extractor selected.</p>
<p>For more information about Replacements and how to use them, check the Documentation at <a
        href="https://blazemeter.github.io/CorrelationRecorder/guide/correlation-rules.html#list-of-correlation-replacements">List
    of Correlation Replacements</a></p>
