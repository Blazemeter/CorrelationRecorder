<b>Correlation Extractors</b>
<p>You can select one Correlation Extractor from this ComboBox, adding configurations that will
    allow you get values from each response</p>

<p>Notice that you don't need to pick a C. Extractor if you don't need it since a rule is <b>
    complete</b>, as long as it has either a Correlation Replacement <br> or a Correlation Extractor selected.</p>

<p>For more information about Extractors and how to use them, check the Documentation at <a
        href="https://github.com/Blazemeter/CorrelationRecorder/blob/master/README.md#list-of-correlation-extractors">List
    Correlation Extractors</a></p>
