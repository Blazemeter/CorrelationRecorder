## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>
  
Correlations Recorder it's a JMeter's plugin that simplifies the process of recording for applications with Dynamic Variables by providing automatic **correlations of variables at recording time**.

After configuring the **Auto-correlation Rules**, you can start the recording like with the normal [HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/jmeter_proxy_step_by_step.html). The plugin will evaluate every Rule that you configured against every response from the server, correlate the dynamic variables found and allow future replays, work like a charm.

## Installation

In this section we will speak about the prerequisites to install the plugin in your JMeter and the process to do it so.

### Prerequisites

In order to use the Correlations Recorder Plugin you need to:

1- Install the [Plugin Manager](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/) in your JMeter folder (if you haven't already). To get a more detailed Installation Guide, please check [this article](https://www.blazemeter.com/blog/how-install-jmeter-plugins-manager/) 
1- (Optional, for Siebel CRM Recording) Set the `httpclient4.deflate_relax_mode` property on true in your user.properties. Setting this property will allow you to avoid any `Unexpected end of input stream` type of errors and you will be able to record in Siebel environments without any troubles.

Remember to save all properties files and restart JMeter for those changes to be considered.

### Downloading and installing

After installing the JMeter Plugins Manager, the Correlation Recorder plugin will be available to automatically download and install it, to do so: 

- Open the JMeter Plugins Manager on JMeter
- Select the Available Plugins tab on JMeter Plugins Manager
- In the search field write Correlation Recorder, and then select the *bzm - Correlation Recorder* plugin’s checkbox
- Click the button Apply Changes and Restart JMeter

### Using it as a Maven dependency

If you use Maven, just include the following dependency in `pom.xml`:

``` xml 
  <dependency>
      <groupId>jmeter.plugins.correlation.recorder</groupId>
      <artifactId>jmeter-bzm-correlation-recorder</artifactId>
      <packaging>jar</packaging>
      <version>1.2</version>
  </dependency>
```

>Check latest version in [releases](https://github.com/Blazemeter/CorrelationRecorder/releases).

## Usage

In this section, we will cover the following topics
* [Backward Compatibility](#backward-compatibility)
* [Basic Concepts](#basic-concepts)
* [Configuration](#configuration) 

### Backward Compatibility

If you are migrating from the previous version, the Siebel's CRM Recorder, don't fear of missing your old configurations, we have implemented the compatibility with those Test Plans. Just load them as you would do and we will automatically migrate them to the new format. The reverse operation isn't supported in the Siebel's CRM Recorder.

### Basic Concepts

Before we jump into the configurations, and explain how to configure all the plugin to work in different scenarios, lets all be in the same page, just in case you might have some doubt about it.

#### Correlating Dynamic Variables

One of the many features that the plugin offers its the possibility of correlating dynamic variables while doing a recording. If you have come to something similar to this, or maybe never have hear about it, the following example will enlighten you out.

##### Simple Login Example

Imagine you are recording a flow where your user logs in and then logs out, the steps are pretty simple, right:

- Go to your login page
- Set the credentials
- Click on login
- (Once inside) Click logout
- Return to your login page

*In some cases*, a normal HTTP Recorder would do that flow without any problem. The thought part comes, when the application also validates dynamic variables like:

- Time of the login
- Session ID
- Form "secret" validation token

If you maintain the same values that you had **The First time you recorded**, the validations will kick in, and the application, will kick you out, not allowing you to finish the flow as expected.

That's the moment when the **Correlations Recorder Plugin** comes in. With some minor configurations, those dynamic values can be captured while you do the recording, and replaced in the following requests, so the app feels and behaves the way it would do, if it was you who logged 1000 times in a minute for your load testing.

**How a Correlation Works**

Based in our previous [Simple Login Example](#simple-login-example), one might have the need to deal with the problem that, some parts of the requests and the responses, might change. That's what its called **a dynamic variable** and, for those who wants to do, load testing, it could be problematic. 

In the previous [Simple Login Example](#simple-login-example), we could see that, some of the **Responses** that are sent by the server, might contain those **dynamic variables** and, in the following **Requests** that we sent to the server should contains them, in order to do the complete cycle. 

The process of **capturing dynamic variables** and **using them** in following request, its called [Correlation](#correlation).

#### Correlation 

Now that you know how the process works, lets talk about the players involved and how those interact between each other.

##### Correlation Extractor

When a **Response** comes from the server, there are ways to get the information, depending on where the value its changing:

- It could change on the URL, for example, using an ID or a Token
- It could be en the Body, set in a field (visible or hidden)
- It could be stored on a Cookie, that has an expiration date

The Correlation Extractor has, as its main responsibility, locate if in any of these cases, there are embedded dynamic variables. In the case where there are, its second responsibility is to extract and save the value so that, in future requests that the app made, other players take those values and replace it, allowing the full cycle to be completed.

##### Correlation Replacement

Now that its known who its the one responsible to extract the values from the responses, its the responsibility to the Correlation Replacement to take those values and replacement them in the following requests, made to the server. 


##### Reference Variable

Even if its not part of the process of correlating dynamic values, when one its extracted, the name of the place where its stored, and from where its going to be taken, in order to replace it, in the subsequent requests, its called Reference Variable. 

Everything that its been explained, so far, will be used in one final tool: a Correlation Rule.

##### Correlation Rule

Once all those concepts are explained, the tool that allows to merge them together, its the Correlation Rule.

Each Correlation Rule contains, a Correlation Extractor, as you now know, to extracts the dynamic value, a Reference Variable, to store the value from the Extractor for the the Replacement, and one Correlation Replacement.

Each one of these rules, will help to make this whole process of capturing and replacing values between responses and requests, not only possible, but also easier than if you manage to do it, alone, using JMeter.

In the following section, we will be talking about how to configure and set the values in each Correlation Rule.

### Configuration

Assuming you know how [Correlations works](#basic-concepts), lets jump into adding and configuring your rules.

Go to *bzm - Correlation Recorder* > click the Rules Tab. 

You will be presented with multiple options to add, move and delete your Correlation Rules Groups, any rule that you want to add must be inside of a group

![Rules Container](docs/rules-container-table.png "Correlation Rules Container")

### Adding Groups

When clicking the *Add* button, a Correlation Group will be added at the bottom of your list of groups.

Each group will contain the header with the buttons to enable/disable, editing group name, and add, remove and move the rules inside the group. Below the header, it is placed the table which will contain all the rules associated to that group 

![Correlation Group](docs/adding-new-group.png "The groups will be inserted at the end")

### Adding Rules

When clicking the **+** button, a Correlation Rule will be added at the bottom of your list of rules. 

Each rule will contain a field in each one of the columns: Reference Variable, Correlation Extractor, and Correlation Replacement

![Correlation Rule](docs/adding-new-rule.png "The rules will be inserted at the end")

Each Correlation Extractor and Correlation Replacement Combo will have a helper icon, right next to it that, when clicked, will display information regarding it (_What it does?_ and _How to customize it?_)

![Correlation Rule Hover](docs/click-helper.gif "Display Informative Helper")

#### Selecting a Correlation Extractor

By default, when a Correlation Rule is added, it will have automatically selected the Regex Correlation Extractor. You can change it by clicking on the combo box on the Correlation Extractor column of that Rule.

![Selecting one Correlation Extractor](docs/selecting-other-correlation-extractor.gif "Selecting one Correlation Extractor")

Each type of Extractor has its own set of parameters, some of them are visible when the extractor is selected, but the advanced ones are hidden by default, those are shown when the parameters section is expanded.

![Expand_Advance_Section Extractor](docs/expand-advance-sextion-extractor.gif "Expanding advance section on Correlation Extractor")

By default, only Regex extractor will be able to be selected, to select other of the extractors available or a custom extractor there is an option **More** in the combo box which will display all the available extractors, here the desired extractor should be selected and added to actives extractors. 

![Add_Custom_Extractor](docs/add_custom_extractor.gif "Adding custom Correlation Extractor")

If another Extractor is selected, the previous values will be deleted. Filling all the fields, with the desired parameters, will allow the plugin to Extract the dynamic values from the responses.

More about how to configure each Correlation Extractor (this and the ones that comes with the Siebel Extension), please refer to our [List of Correlation Extractors](#list-of-correlation-extractors) section.

#### Selecting a Correlation Replacement

Just like the Correlation Extractors, the Regex Correlation Replacement will be selected, by default, when adding a Correlation Rule. 

![Selecting Replacement Correlation](docs/selecting-other-correlation-replacement.gif "Selecting one Correlation Replacement")

Also, Correlation Replacements have their own Advance section, like Correlation Extractors

![Expand_Advance_Section Replacement](docs/expand-advance-sextion-replacement.gif "Expanding advance section on Correlation Replacement")

As in Correlation Extractor, here to add any Correlation Replacement the option  **more** should be used.

![Add_Custom_Replacement](docs/add_custom_replacement.gif "Adding custom Correlation Replacement")

And their behavior goes sames as its predecessor. Once one option its selected, the fields to configure it, will be displayed right next to it.

More about how to configure each Correlation Replacements (this and the ones that comes with the Siebel Extension), please refer to our [List of Correlation Replacements](#list-of-correlation-replacements) section.

Note that, each time you select a different Extractor or Replacement, inside your correlation rule, the values that you had set to the respective fields, will be lost. For Saving your Rule configurations, before getting creative, please refer to the [Saving and Loading Rules](#saving-and-loading-rules) section.

#### Reference Variable

Once a value its extracted for the Correlation Extractor, its stored in a variable, this field will determine the name of it. In future request, the Correlation Replacement will be applied and, if it successfully finds the place to apply it, will bring the value from here and replacement it there, for a smooth transition.

### List of Correlation Extractors

All the Correlation Extractors mentioned below comes either installed by default in the plugin, or as a part of the preloaded Siebel Template. To know more about how to load and save Correlation Rules Templates, please refer to the [Saving and Loading Rules](#saving-and-loading-rules) section, for further details about it.

In case none of the following ones fits the desired behavior your application requires, to correlate the dynamic variables that it might have, feel free to read the [Customizing your one extensions](CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS.md) section that we have prepared for you.

**Regex**

RegEx stands for Regular Expression, and relies on the use of Regular Expressions to find where the dynamic variable might found.

When the regular expression its matched, a Regex Extractor will be added to the sample when:

1. The Regular Expression is matched, based on the configured properties 
2. The matched value is not repeated

This extractor comes installed, by default, in the plugin, and it receives 4 fields to be able to work properly:

![Regex Correlation Extractor](docs/regex-correlation-extractor.png)

1. *RegEx*: which corresponds to the Regular Expression that will be used to perform the extraction.
1. *Match Number*: In the case that the Regex matches more than once in the response, this number will indicate which one of all of them it's going to be extracted.
1. *Match Group*: In the case that the Regex contains, more than one group, this field indicates which one of those its going to be considered to do the extraction, once the Regex its matched.
1. *Target*: Which field to check the regular expression against.
      * *The following fields can be checked: (from JMeter documentation):*
      * *Body* - the body of the response, e.g. the content of a web-page (excluding headers)
      * *Body (unescaped)* - the body of the response, with all Html escape codes replaced. Note that Html escapes are processed wi thout regard of context, so some incorrect substitutions may be made. Note that this option highly impacts performances, so use it only when absolutely necessary and be aware of its impacts.
      * *Body as a Document* - extract text from various type of documents via Apache Tika. Note that Body as a Document option can impact performance, so ensure it is OK for your test.
      * *Request Headers* - the request header of the HTTP sampler.
      * *Response Headers* - the response header of the HTTP sampler.
      * *URL*
      * *Response Code* - e.g. 200
      * *Response Message* - e.g. OK
1. *Multivalued*: The multi-valuation is useful when we want to match multiple appearances of our regex in a response. Variables extracted with multivalued are non-overwritable and additionally they have a specific format.  See [Variable Generation](#variable-generation) for case usages and variable formats.		                

In case the Regex Extractor is not matched, during a Replay of a Recorded flow, the replaced value will be `<Reference Variable Name> + "_NOT_FOUND"`. 

**SiebelRow**

This Correlation Extractor comes in the already installed Siebel's Template. To know more about how to load and save Correlation Rules Templates, please refer to the [Saving and Loading Rules](#saving-and-loading-rules) section, for further details about it.

![Siebel Row Correlation Extractor](docs/siebel-row-correlation-extractor.png)

The Siebel Row Correlation Extractor works in a similar way like the previously mentioned RegEx, with the main differences that:
 
- This applies a "Siebel Star Array strings" parsing function over the matched regex and store the parsed values as variables. 
- Regarding the Parameters expected, Siebel Row Correlation Extractor uses all but the *Match Number*, since it parses every match it founds.
- Last, but not least, if the Regex its matched, a JSR223PostProcessor will be added to the sampler.

*For a better understanding, lets do an example*

Let's say that the String we want to extract and, therefore, apply this extracting and parsing function, its

`8\*testUser12\*testPassword6\*VRId-0`

The plugin will searches for the number before an occurrence of "\*", uses that value as the length of the number of characters to store, and then repeats if there is another occurrence of "*".

If the Reference Variable is set to *VAR*, the split strings returned will be set in variables names like ${VAR_1}, ${VAR_2}, ${VAR_3} etc. and, the count of variables is returned as ${VAR_n}. 

The stored values for that string, at the end, will be:

* VAR_n=3 
* VAR_1=testUser 
* VAR_2=testPassword 
* VAR_3=VRId-0 

### Star Array Correlation

When the server returns variables using a star array, the plugin will parse the array and generate a new variable for each of the parameters, using the specified prefix name.


## Variable Generation

The creation of JMeter variables for later usage is one of the pillars of this plugin. Therefore, this section is specially dedicated to understand and review all the possible scenarios.

The generation and assignment of variables are tied to the Extractors which are the ones in charge of extracting the matches and store them. Therefore, a detailed explanation of extractor configuration will be covered during this section.

The most used and complex extractor is the [Regex Extractor](#list-of-correlation-extractors). 
This section will be divided into cases, from simple and common cases to unusual ones.

### Extract specific match from the response (overwritable) 

|  | Description |
|---|---|
| Objective | extract the second appearance of a character chain included on the response that matches the given regex |
| Configuration | need to specify a variable name (the variable stored will use it), regex, desired match number and no need to check for multi-valued |
| Visualization |![extractor_configuration_visualization](docs/extractor/configuration/extraction-specific-match-overwritable.png) |
| Overall | value will be stored in a JMeter variable, with the exact name as the value introduced on the reference variable name field. **If a variable exists (from previous extractions) the variable will be overwritten with new match value** |

### Extract specific match from a response (not overwritable)
|  | Description |
|---|---|
| Objective | extract a certain value from a specific match number on the response. The value will be saved in a non-overwritable variable. | 
| Configuration | variable name, regex, desired match number and **multivalue must be selected** | 
| Visualization | ![extractor_configuration_visualization](docs/extractor/configuration/extraction-specific-match-non-overwritable.png) |
| Overall | value will be extracted and stored in a variable with the following convention: E.g: `var#34` <ul><li>**var**: reference variable name</li><li>**#34**: represents the variable count number</li></ul> Note: this variable will endure the whole execution | 

### Extract multiple variables that can be overwritten

|  | Description |
|---|---|
| Objective | extract all values that match the regex on the response |
| Configuration | variable name, regex, **match number needs to be lower than 0** (E.g: -1). No need for multi-valued. |
| Visualization | ![extractor_configuration_visualization](docs/extractor/configuration/extraction-multiple-overwritable.png) |
| Overall | a new variable will be created to store every match found on the response. If the variable already exists, it will be overwritten. The format of this type of variable consists of a prefix (reference variable name) with an underscore followed by the integer which represents the match number of the extracted value. E.g: **ID_1** <br> **Important**: If variables are been extracted in previous responses, for instance, 5 matches (`ID_1, ID_2,..., ID_5`), when another response arrives with new matches, these variables will not just be overwritten, will be deleted. If the new response matches thrice, then the resultant variables will be `ID_1, ID_2, ID_3`. Previous variables `ID_4` and `ID_5` will no longer exist. |


### Extract multiple variables that can NOT be overwritten

|  | Description |
|------|---|
| Objetive | extract all values that match the regex on the response and store them immutably |
| Configuration | variable name, regex, **match number needs to be lower than 0** (E.g: -1). **_Multi-valued needs to be checked_** |
| Visualization | ![extractor_configuration_visualization](docs/extractor/configuration/extraction-multiple-non-overwritable.png) |
| Overall | a new variable will be created to store every match found on the response. This type of extractions have a particular format name. E.g:  `myVar#2_1` Where: <ul><li>**myVar**: reference variable name</li><li>**#2**: hash followed by the variable count number</li><li>**\_1**: number of match in that response</li></ul><br>New JMeter variables are created (with the format showed above) every time a response arrives, and the regex matches more than twice.<br> Note: if the response contains one match, and optimization is done. Therefore, the generated variable will be like in section  _Extract specific match from a response (not overwritable)_ |

## Variable Replacement

The replacement of dynamic or static data in a request for JMeter Variables is one of the main objectives of the **Correlation Recorder**.

Mainly, the idea is to replace data for variables, therefore, we get a proper correlated script.
The data we want to replace needs to match a certain regex, condition or even a criteria. 
The variable replacement system does support the scenario when the match needs to be replaced for a literal instead of a JMeter Variable (not common case).

Let's give an example in order to set the idea of a replacement.
Suppose we have a website were is possible to buy products. Those products are identified by a unique id. 
Our objective will be to replace the id number for a JMeter Variable, to later on, buy any product of the store just by modifying the JMeter Variable value.
Considering an url like `www.my-market-place.com/cart.html?product_id=2`
The regex we have to build in order to match the data we want to replace, it should be something like: `product_id=(\d)`. 
The result we are looking for should be a request with a parametrized value, in that case, the id number.
The desired result will look something like: 
`www.my-market-place.com/cart.html?product_id=${id_product}`

Now that we have a basic idea of a replacement, lets explain the most complex and used replacement. The *Regex Correlation Replacement* which accepts three parameters:

 1. **regex**: the regex needed to match the data to be replaced on a request.
 2. **replacementString**: this field is used to set JMeter Functions, or even literals to be used on the comparision of the replace match value (if value is not ignored).
 3. **ignore value**: this check will determine if the match will be compared against all the JMeter Variables or even the execution of a function that can be declared on the `replacementString` field. When is checked, it will replace without comparing.
 
>  Below is shown all the possible scenarios. Each scenario contains an *Objective* which will explain the problem we want to achieve. *Pre-loaded variables* will set us in a current variable context, in consideration of generating those variables is mandatory to read the section [variable-generation](#variable-generation). *Context* will provide all necessary information for the scenario, as a global configuration will work under the domain `www.my-market-place.com`. The *Visualization* will show the configuration made on the replacement in order to achieve the desired result.  

### Replace single parameter for a variable in request
|  | Description |  
|---|---|  
| Objective | replace a parameter of a request for a JMeter Variable. |
| Pre-loaded variables | `ID` = 2 | 
| Context | Request is `/cart.html?product_id=2` | 
| Visualization | ![single_parameter_replacement](docs/replacement/configuration/single-parameter-replacement.png) |  
| Overall | Once the regex matches on the request, the matched value will be `2`. Then it will compare the matched value against all the variables stored. When the matched value equals any variable stored, the replacement will be triggered |
| Replacement result | `www.my-market-place.com/cart.html?product_id=${ID}` |

### Replace multiple parameters for variables in request
|  | Description |  
|---|---|  
| Objective | replace multiple parameters of a request for JMeter Variables. |
| Pre-loaded variables | `ID_1` = 2, `ID_2` = 3, `ID_3` = 4,  `ID_SESSION` = rP/tHk<tsR!v> | 
| Context | Request is `/cart.html?product_id=2&product_id=4` | 
| Visualization | ![multiple_parameter_replacement](docs/replacement/configuration/multiple-parameter-replacement.png) |  
| Overall | For this multi replacement, the regex will match twice (two appearances of `product_id`), therefore, each matched value will be replaced for the variables containing same value. |
| Replacement result | `www.my-market-place.com/cart.html?product_id=${ID_1}&product_id=${ID_3}` |

### Replace a parameter for the result of a variable transformation in request
|  | Description |  
|---|---|  
| Objective | replace a parameter in request that uses a pre-loaded variable but transformed. |
| Pre-loaded variables | `ID` = 2,  `ID_SESSION` = rP/tHk<tsR!v> | 
| Context | Request is `/index.html?session=rP%2FtHk%3CtsR%21v%3E`. In this particular case, the session id is extracted decoded (*ID_SESSION* value) , but on the request it is encoded. Therefore, the stored variable will be different to the matched value on the request. Because of that, we need to use the field `replacementString` in order to make that transformation. For this example we are using a JMeter Function called [urlencode](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/functions.html#__urlencode) | 
| Visualization | ![single-transformed-replacement](docs/replacement/configuration/single-transformed-replacement.png) |  
| Overall | Since the replacement string is not empty, the plugin will execute (if executable, could also be a literal) the content. The result of the execution will be used to compare against the regex replacement matched value. When those values match, the replacement is made by placing the content of replacementString on the request. |
| Replacement result | `www.my-market-place.com/index.html?session=${__urlencode(${ID_SESSION})}` |

### Replace multiple parameters for the result of a variable transformation in request
|  | Description |  
|---|---|  
| Objective | replace a parameter in request that uses pre-loaded variables but transformed. |
| Pre-loaded variables | `prod_1=red car`,  `prod_2=blue car` | 
| Context | Request is `delete.html?identifier=red+car&indetifier=blue+car`. In this case, we have to replace two parameters of the request. The value that will be placed on the request, needs to be encoded. Since the pre-loaded variables are not encoded, we need to make a transformation | 
| Visualization | ![multiple-transformed-replacement](docs/replacement/configuration/multiple-transformed-replacement.png) |  
| Overall | Similar to the previous scenario, in order to proper replace for variables, we have to make a transformation, that will be done by calling the [__urlencode](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/functions.html#__urlencod) function provided by JMeter. Since the pre-loaded variables are result of a multiple extraction. The replacement string will have the variable name without the suffix. The plugin automatically will detect that and it will access to all the stored values for that reference variable name. |
| Replacement result | `www.my-market-place.com/index.html?identifier=${__urlencode(${prod_1})}&identifier=${__urlencode(${prod_2})}` |

### Replace single parameter ignoring matched value
|  | Description |  
|---|---|  
| Objective | replace a parameter in request that uses pre-loaded variables but transformed. |
| Pre-loaded variables | No variables used for this case | 
| Context | Request is `/main.html?time=1516540541624`. This request contains a parameter which is the current time in milliseconds, therefore, if we had that value stored in a variable it will not work, since we need to set a request with the current time. Threfore we will use the function [__time()](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/functions.html#__time) provided by JMeter | 
| Visualization | ![ignore_value_replacement](docs/replacement/configuration/ignore-value-replacement.png) |  
| Overall | It is not possible to compare values in order to achieve our objective, therefore we need to set the current time neglecting the previous value. For that reason the ignore value is checked, it will not execute and compare the replacement string content. |
| Replacement result | `www.my-market-place.com/main.html?time=${__time()}` |


## List of Correlation Replacements

All the Correlation Replacements mentioned below comes either installed by default in the plugin, or as a part of the preloaded Siebel Template. To know more about how to load and save Correlation Rules Templates, please refer to the [Saving and Loading Rules](#saving-and-loading-rules) section, for further details about it.

In case none of the following Replacements fits the desired behavior your application requires, to correlate the dynamic variables that it might have, feel free to read the [Customizing your one extensions](CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS.md) section that we have prepared for you.

**Regex**

Similarly to the *Correlation Extractor Regex*, this one also receives a Regular Expression in order to find where the stored value is going to be replaced. Additionally, if a regex extractor with multivalued was added, the replacement will be applied automatically. It will look for a variable with same value as the request match in order to make the replacement. In short, no need to configure replacement to work with a multi-value or single-value. 

![Regex Correlation Replacement](docs/regex-correlation-replacement.png)

**Siebel Counter**

This Correlation Replacement replaced the matched regex with a counter that holds the value of each time it has matched on the moment the replacement occurs.

**Siebel Row Id**

This replacement adds *_rowId* to the Reference Variable name before each replacement, and search the value of the regex on rows of the Siebel Context. After this, it behaves like a regular RegEx Replacement using the Siebel Context

**SiebelRowParams**

Similarly to the rest of the Correlation that involves Regex, this Replacement will receive a Regular Expression as param, its going to search for the first occurrence of the first group of (), inside the Siebel Context values, extracted previously by the SiebelRow's CorrelationExtractor, and replace the respective value following the formula `RefVar` + _ + `RowNumber`.

### Delete and Clear

Additionally to Add, functionalities like Delete and Clear, might come handy.

When selecting a rule (setting the whole rule with a different background), you can delete it by clicking the Delete button. Also, if you want to delete all the rules that you have until now, pressing Clear will do the trick.

If you delete or clear your rules, they will be lost, and there is no way of recovering then after that. So before doing so, remember that you can always [Save Your Correlation Rules into Templates](#saving-and-loading-rules), before deleting some or removing all at once.

### Priorities

Before you run your recorder and test your rules against the app, its **IMPORTANT** to mention that the order of rules, in your Rules Container, indicates the priority they have, therefore, the order in which they will be applied to every Request and Response.

If you want to change the priorities, you can use the UP and DOWN buttons, after selecting any rule, to move it up and down, respectively.

One other feature that the plugin allows is saving a set of groups of rules, also known as **Correlation Templates**, without the need to save the whole Test plan. You can load your previously saved templates or even other ones shared by third parties. Please refer to our [Sharing Repositories](#sharing-repositories) section to know more about sharing templates for further details.

### Saving your Templates

Once you are finished configuring your Correlation Rules, you are able to save it. By default, it will take a screenshot of the rules you have in your application. This image, know as the snapshot, can be replaced by yourself if you desire to change it.

**How to Save your Rules**

Click on the Save Template Button in the Top Left corner of the Correlations Rules Container. 

The following Form will appear:

![Save Template Form](docs/save-correlation-template.png)

No need for your to figure each one by yourself, the following list does it for you:

* ID: Its an "identification name" for your Correlation Template. **It has to be unique**, or the plugin won't allow you to save it.
* Version: This its very self-explanatory field. Depending on how many times you have loaded and saved your template, you can set a version "name" (since it doesn't need to be a number). Just like the ID, **it has to be unique**.
* Description: Its a field that allows you to explain more about your Template. You can get creative and, also, add HTML tags. (Paragraphs, bold, links, etc).
* Changes: This field allows you to keep track of the changes made on the Template.
* Dependencies: This field allows you to add any particular library (.jar) file that your Template needs in order to work.

![Dependencies Table](docs/dependencies-table.png)

Since its an **Advanced** feature, we left it collapsed by default.
Its IMPORTANT that, if you decide to add a dependency, the name and the version should be contained in the final file, that way, we can recognize it from the rest of the versions it might have.
Also, any overlapping dependencies, after an alert dialog, will be overwritten it, leaving just the one that was added at the end.

### Loading Templates

No matter if the Correlation Templates on your system are yours or if they come from another person, when you click on "Load Template", in the Left Top Corner of the Correlations Rule container, the Correlation Template Manager will appear.

In this Manager you can see the Installed and the Available Templates. The first ones will contain, at least, one of its versions installed in your system, the later are all downloaded but, none of its versions are installed.

To been able to load a Correlation Template in your Rules container, you need, first, to install it. Installing a version of a Template that has already a version installed, will overwrite the previous one.

Once you install a Template, you will be able to load it in the Rules container, and use it as it was saved.

Its important to mention that, every time you load a Template, the rules, filters and extensions contained inside that template will be appended to the ones you have already built in your Rules Container, this way, you can use as many templates as you want before doing one recording. 

When you load a single template, edit it and attempt to save it, the information of that last loaded template will, by default, be set in the "Save Template" form, allowing you to update it as a local version of it. That behavior changes when you load more than one template or when you press the "Clear" Button.

**NOTE**

If one Template's Version contains dependencies that overlap with other dependencies in the `/lib` folder, an alert will be shown that, if accepted, will delete all "conflicting" dependencies in that folder. You might need to take actions here in the case you don't want those dependencies lost.

Once you have installed Repositories ( as explained in [External Repository](#external-repository)), you will also see the Templates from those Repositories in the list as well. The ones created or saved, in your machine, will be followed by a `(local)` suffix on their name. All Templates will always contain the ID of their Repository Owner, also, in the description.

### Default Templates

By default, the plugin creates a Template with the most commonly used Siebel Correlation rules

When the Siebel Template its loaded, a set of rules with the most common Siebel dynamic values that need to be parameterized will be added. 

## Sharing Repositories

One amazing feature that the plugin has its the possibility to add and share sets of templates, as one, also known as **Repository**. One Repository might contain different versions of one same Template, or even multiple versions or different templates. 

In this section you will learn: how to import third parties Repositories, to extend your Load Testing and how to share yours

### External Repository

In the case that someone has offered to share their custom rules for certain applications, you can either download it by your means, and use the local route, or you can use the URL of the repository and let the Plugin to download it for you.

To add external Repositories, go to your Rules Container > Click on Load Templates > Click on Config. After that, you will be presented with the Repositories Manager

![Repositories Manager](docs/repositories-manager.png)

**Adding a Repository**

To add a new Repository: 

* Set an **unique** name 
* Set the path or url where the Repository its located
* Click on Add

After that, the plugin will do its magic and a message will appear indicating either the Repository was successfully added or if it was any problem.

**View Templates within a Repository**

As mentioned in [Loading Templates](#loading-templates), to see any Template that belongs in a Repository, go to your Templates Manager (Load Template, Top Left Corner in the Rules Container), click on the search field and write the name of the Repository.

Either in the Installed or in the Available tabs (depending if the Template has installed versions or not), the Templates associated to that search text, will be shown.

![Filtered by Repository Owner](docs/template-manager-filtered.png)

### Local Repository

### Sharing your Repository

# Making your own Repositories

By default, when you save one template, it gets recorded in your Local Repository. If you decide to export certain set of Templates, to share or just simple to store somewhere else, you need to follow this steps.

1. Copy the local-repository.json file into a new folder (Example: MyRepository/)
2. Open the local-repository.json file and remove the templates you don't want to use, leaving the ones you want to export

	When you open the local-repository.json file, you will see that it has the following structure:
	
	```JSON
	{
	  "name" : {
	    "versions" : [ "versionId" ]
	  }
	}
	```
	
	**Where**:
	
	name: its the name of the template that you are have in your local repository
	versions: its an array with all the versions of that template
	versionId: its the id or the name of the version of that template.
	
	**For example**:
	
	If we want to export a repository that contains the version 1.0 and 2.0 of the Template "Social" and version 0.1 of the Template "Media", the repository file would look like this:
	
	```JSON
	{
	  "Social" : {
	    "versions" : [ "1.0", "2.0" ]
	  },
	  "Media" : {
	    "versions" : [ "0.1"]
	  }
	}
	```

3. Add all the JSON files of the templates you mentioned in the repository file
4. (Optional) Add all the snapshots for the templates

Also, there are considerations you need to have in mind to been able to access this file, and download it:

1. Every file should be on the same level. No sub-folders are required
2. Depending where the folder would be:
   - If you upload this folder in the cloud: the URL to access those files need to be publicly available
   - If you share the folder: the folder should be readable
3. All the files must maintain the original names or, at least, follow the structure.

**File Naming Structure**

In this section, we will list the name structure for the files contained in a repository

| Type       | Formula                                                         | Example                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | 
| Repository | `[Repository name] + repository.json`                           | *example-repository.json*    |
| Template   | `[Template Name] - [Template Version] + -template.json`         | *twitter-1.0-template.json*  |
| Snapshot   | `[Template Name] - [Template Version] + -snapshot.png`          | *snapshot-1.0-template.json* |


## Filtering your Requests

One of the features that the Correlation's Recorder offers, is the possibility to filter the responses that will be recorded.

![Filter responses by MIME Type](docs/filtering-responses-with-info.png)

The filtering applies based on the MIME Types of the response and, the strings used in this field can be:

* Specific: using the whole MIME type you want to filter. eg: `text/html`
* Generic: using regular expressions. eg: `text\/(html|css)`
* Multiple: using any combination of the mentioned so far, comma separated. eg: `text/html, application\/(json|xml)`. 

For more information about the MIME types definitions and/or most used ones, check [Iana's definitions](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) or [Mozilla's HTTP Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) or .
