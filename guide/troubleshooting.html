This template also has all the required elements in the correct order and in the right places so that the information is not only shown correctly but can also be used in the debugging process.</p> <p>The most common debugging tips are:</p> <ul><li>Enable the Debug Post processor element when doing the replay as it will show the variables in JMeter by the moment the replay reaches that particular step.</li> <li>Always review the state of the value in both the recording and the replay. It is pretty common that the value is not being displayed correctly in the rendered view in JMeter (due to the encoding of the value).</li> <li>Use the Raw Display of the values in the view result tree. It is pretty common that, when using other rendering of the results in JMeter, the value is shown in a different manner than its real state, making it difficult to debug.</li> <li>Keep the Test Plan as clean as possible. Always try to filter the requests that are not needed (such as fonts, styles, telemetry, google ads, etc.) as they only add noise to the debugging process.</li> <li>Alternatively, the opposite is also possible: add all the elements to the Test Plan, in cases where you might end up filtering requests that could contain important information for the correlation. This does not occur that often with the default filters added to the template, but if you find yourself simply unable to locate a value (neither in the recording nor the replay), it could be possible that it was filtered.</li></ul> <h2 id="how-to-properly-report-an-issue"><a href="#how-to-properly-report-an-issue" class="header-anchor">#</a> How to properly report an issue</h2> <p>If by the end of the debugging process you are still not able to find the root cause of the issue, you can always

This means that the Test Plan is not being executed in the same way as it was recorded.</p> <p>This can happen for a variety of reasons, but the most common ones are:</p> <ul><li>The Test Plan's elements is not being executed in the same order as it was recorded.</li> <li>The Test Plan is missing elements that were present in the recording.</li> <li>The Test Plan has elements that are disabled and are relevant in the recording.</li></ul> <h3 id="checking-the-server-responses"><a href="#checking-the-server-responses" class="header-anchor">#</a> Checking the server responses</h3> <p>Another common reason as why the Templates or Rules do not work is because the responses from the server are totally different from the recording. This means that the server is not responding with the same values as it was recorded.</p> <p>This can happen for a variety of reasons, but the most common ones are:</p> <ul><li>The server returns a different response due to:
<ul><li>previous requests not being properly correlated.</li> <li>the Test Plan not being consistent.</li> <li>Additional configuration's required to run the Test Plan.</li></ul></li> <li>The server needs Javascript to be executed in order to return the correct response.</li></ul> <h2 id="faq"><a href="#faq" class="header-anchor">#</a> FAQ</h2> <h3 id="the-value-that-i-need-to-correlate-does-not-appear-in-the-tree-view"><a href="#the-value-that-i-need-to-correlate-does-not-appear-in-the-tree-view" class="header-anchor">#</a> The value that I need to Correlate does not appear in the Tree View</h3> <p>This is a pretty common issue that can affect the capabilities of you or the plugin to correlate a value.</p> <p>The most common reasons are:</p> <ol><li>Cookies and cached values are not being cleared before recording.</li> <li>Requests are being filtered on recording.</li></ol> <p>Can these be fixed? Yes, they can. Here is how:</p> <h4 id="cookies-and-cached-values-are-not-being-cleared-before-recording"><a href="#cookies-and-cached-values-are-not-being-cleared-before-recording" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cookies and cached values are not being cleared before recording</h4> <p>The short recommendation for this problem is: <strong>Always clear your cookies and cached values before recording</strong></p> <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p> <p>If your browser has <strong>cached values</strong> or <strong>cookies</strong> from previous sessions, it is possible that the value you are trying
to correlate <strong>is not being sent to JMeter</strong> from the server (because your browser already has the value stored and
use it directly).</p> <p>This is why we always <strong>recommend</strong> to <em>clear your cookies and cached values before recording</em> or <em>make a new Incognito
session in your browser</em> each time you record.</p> <h4 id="requests-are-being-filtered-on-recording"><a href="#requests-are-being-filtered-on-recording" class="header-anchor">#</a> Requests are being filtered on recording</h4> <p>If the Request are being filtered on recording, it is possible that the server is sending the request to JMeter,
but it is not being stored since it matches the filtering configurations.</p> <p>By default, these filtered request won't appear in the Recording's View Result tree. However, you can disable this
behavior and retry the recording to ensure this is the problem.</p> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Only use this for debugging purposes since the plugin can misbehave if there are inconsistencies between the recorded elements and the requests that are stored in the View Result Tree.</p> <p>Along the possible issues this can cause, the most common ones are:</p> <ul><li>The plugin will identify values in requests that is not part of the Test Plan and will make incorrect suggestions. This will give the impression of a value being correlated when it is not.</li> <li>The plugin will identify the appearance of a value more times than it should. This will give the impression of a value being more important than it actually is.</li> <li>The analysis (either by Templates or by Automatic detection) will take longer than usual since it will have to go through all the requests in the View Result Tree, even the ones that are not part of the Test Plan.</li></ul></div> <p>Before jumping into conclusions, let's test the hypothesis that the request is being filtered.</p> <p><strong>Check if the request appears in the Recording JTL:</strong></p> <ol><li>Go to your Test Plan</li> <li>Click in the &quot;bzm - Auto Correlation Recorder&quot; element</li> <li>Click the &quot;View Results Tree&quot; element</li></ol> <p>Either manually review the list of elements or use the search field to find the request you are looking for.</p> <p>If the request does not appear in the recording JTL, it might have been filtered.
If the request is present in the recording JTL, it was not filtered.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>If the request is present in the Recording JTL but the name appears between brackets ([]), it means that the request was filtered, and you have the notify children option enabled.</p></div> <p><strong>Disable the filtering of requests in the Recording JTL:</strong>
If you validated that the request is being filtered, you can disable the filtering of requests in the Recording JTL by following these steps:</p> <ol><li>Go to the Request filtering tab (Test Plan &gt; bzm - Auto Correlation Recorder &gt; Requests Filtering
tab).</li> <li>Check the &quot;Notify Child Listeners of filtered samplers&quot; option at the bottom of the
element in the &quot;Notify Child Listeners of filtered samplers&quot; section.</li> <li>Clear the recording (Test Plan &gt; Recording Controller &gt; Clear all the recorded samples).</li> <li>Clear the Recording JTL (Test Plan &gt; bzm - Auto Correlation Recorder &gt; View Results Tree &gt;
Right Click &gt; Clear).</li> <li>Record again.</li></ol> <p>Now, when you check the Recording's View Result Tree, you should see all the requests that are being sent to JMeter.
The ones that are being filtered will appear between brackets ([]), while the ones that are not being filtered will
appear normally (without the wrapping brackets).</p> <p>Just like the previous step, you can either manually review the list of elements or use the search field to find the
request you are looking for.</p> <p>If you confirmed that the request is being filtered, you might need to review the filtering configuration to ensure
that the request is not being filtered.</p> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> You will feel tempted to leave the &quot;Notify Child Listeners of filtered samplers&quot; option enabled. However, this is not recommended since it can cause the plugin to misbehave.
Likewise, we highly encourage you to fine tune the filtering configuration to ensure that the request is not being filtered rather than removing the filtering altogether. Having extra requests in the Recording will only make the analysis slower and suggest values that are not relevant or should not be correlated.</p></div> <h2 id="your-regular-expression-is-not-matching-the-value-you-are-trying-to-correlate"><a href="#your-regular-expression-is-not-matching-the-value-you-are-trying-to-correlate" class="header-anchor">#</a> Your regular expression is not matching the value you are trying to correlate</h2> <p>More often than not, the regular expression that you are using to correlate a value is not matching the value you are
trying to correlate.</p> <p>Depending on which part of the Correlation Rule you are configuring or testing, you might need to use a different
mechanism to validate that the regular expression is matching the value you are trying to correlate.</p> <h3 id="for-extraction"><a href="#for-extraction" class="header-anchor">#</a> For Extraction</h3> <p>You can test your Regex inside JMeter by going into your Recording's View Result Tree do one of the following:</p> <ol><li>Search by Regular exp.</li> <li>Use the &quot;RegExp Tester&quot; view.</li></ol> <h3 id="for-replacement"><a href="#for-replacement" class="header-anchor">#</a> For Replacement</h3> <p>By default, the Plugin will concatenate both the <code>name of the argument</code> and <code>value</code> with <code>:</code>, when evaluating the replacement.</p> <p>For instance:
If the value you want to correlate appears in the HTTP Sampler as <code>wpnonce</code> (in name's column) and <code>123ABC</code> (in value's column), when the plugin tries to match the Regex, it will do it against <code>wpnonce: 123ABC</code>.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>Even if your Regex matches the value you are trying to correlate, in the request body or headers, you still need to make sure that the Extractor effectively extracted the value you are trying to correlate.</p></div> <h2 id="how-to-confirm-the-value-is-being-extracted-correctly"><a href="#how-to-confirm-the-value-is-being-extracted-correctly" class="header-anchor">#</a> How to confirm the value is being extracted correctly</h2> <p>If you are not sure if the value is being extracted correctly, you can use the &quot;Debug Post-Processor&quot; to confirm it.</p> <p>To do this, you need to:</p> <ol><li>Add a &quot;Debug Post-Processor&quot; to your Test Plan.</li> <li>Add a &quot;View Results Tree&quot; element to your Test Plan.</li> <li>Replay the Test Plan</li></ol> <p>You will see that now every request will have a child element inside them in the View Result Tree. Inside this child element, in the Response Body tab, you will see all the JMeter variables and their respective values during the replay in that request.</p> <p>If your Regex Extractor is located inside the Request #1, the value will appear (or will be available) from the Request #2 onwards.</p> <p>If the variable <strong>is not present</strong> in the Debug Sampler, it means that the <strong>regex is not matching</strong> any value in the recording until that point and that <strong>you don't have a default value assigned to it</strong>.
If the variable <strong>is present</strong> but the <strong>value is &quot;NOT_FOUND&quot;</strong>, it means that the regex <strong>is not matching</strong> any value.
If the variable <strong>is present</strong> but the value <strong>is not the one that you want</strong>, it means <strong>you need to improve</strong> either <strong>the Regex</strong> or <strong>the configuration</strong> of the Extractor.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
